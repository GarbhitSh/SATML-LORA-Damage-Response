## Project Overview

This system integrates machine learning and LoRa technology for real-time monitoring and reporting of environmental and structural damage. The project is built to function in areas with limited internet connectivity, using LoRa for long-distance, low-power communication to transmit data reliably.

## REPO Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **damage report**: Contains datasets, analysis scripts, and reports related to the assessment of damage data. This section is essential for understanding how damage data is analyzed and processed.
- **Detection and Mapping System**: Contains core components for the detection and mapping of damage. This includes algorithms and utilities for generating maps and marking affected areas based on input data.
- **Lora Alerts App**: A LoRa-based application responsible for sending alerts. This app is designed to communicate alerts from the detection system to the end users over the LoRa network.
- **Lora Module**: Houses the configuration and setup scripts for the LoRa module, enabling wireless communication between devices over long distances.


## Machine Learning Component

The machine learning (ML) component plays a crucial role in detecting and mapping damage. It uses trained models to classify and assess damage levels in real-time.

For detailed information about the ML model setup, training, testing, and parameter adjustments, please refer to the [Machine Learning README](https://github.com/GarbhitSh/SATML-LORA-Damage-Response/blob/main/Lora%20Alerts%20App/README.md). This separate README will provide comprehensive instructions and documentation specific to the ML part of the project.

## LoRa Module for Wireless Communication

The **LoRa Module** is designed for long-range, low-power wireless communication, making it ideal for this project. This module enables devices to communicate damage data across considerable distances without a stable internet connection.

### Key Features

- **Long-Range Communication**: Supports communication over kilometers.
- **Low Power**: Ensures efficient energy consumption, suitable for battery-powered devices in remote locations.
- **High Penetration**: Allows for effective communication even in obstructed environments.
- **Network Scalability**: Can support a network of devices, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

### Setup

1. **Hardware Setup**: Follow the instructions provided in the `Lora Module` folder for connecting LoRa modules to your devices.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust the configuration files in this folder to set network parameters such as frequency, spreading factor, and bandwidth.
3. **Testing**: Run the test scripts to verify communication between devices.
